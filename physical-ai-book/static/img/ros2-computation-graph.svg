# Placeholder for ROS 2 Computation Graph Diagram

This is a placeholder image file for the ROS 2 computation graph diagram referenced in Chapter 1.

The diagram shows:
- Multiple nodes communicating via topics, services, and actions
- The relationship between different components of the robotic nervous system
- How nodes, topics, and services interact in the ROS 2 architecture
