# Chapter 1: ROS 2 Architecture & Core Concepts

Welcome to the first chapter of our Physical AI and Robotics book! This chapter introduces you to ROS 2 as the robotic nervous system for humanoid robots. You'll learn how ROS 2 bridges Python AI agents to ROS controllers and understand the fundamentals of embodied intelligence in physical environments.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Articulate the difference between traditional AI systems and embodied AI systems using ROS 2
- Explain how ROS 2 serves as the nervous system connecting AI agents to physical robot control
- Understand the core architecture of ROS 2 and its role in robotics
