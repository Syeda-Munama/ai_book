# Introduction to Physical AI and Robotics

Welcome to the Physical AI and Robotics book! This educational resource is designed for university students with AI/CS backgrounds who want to learn about Physical AI for humanoid robotics, focusing on ROS 2 as the middleware for robot control.

## About This Book

This book covers 4 core chapters that progressively build your understanding of ROS 2 as the robotic nervous system:

1. **ROS 2 Architecture & Core Concepts** - Foundational understanding of ROS 2
2. **Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions** - Practical implementation of ROS 2 communication
3. **Building ROS 2 Packages with Python (rclpy)** - Advanced development techniques
4. **Launch Files, Parameters, and URDF for Humanoids** - Complete system integration

## Target Audience

This book is designed for:
- University students with AI/CS background
- Those learning Physical AI for humanoid robotics
- Developers interested in bridging Python AI agents to ROS controllers
- Anyone interested in embodied intelligence in physical environments

## How to Use This Book

Each chapter builds upon the previous one, but is designed to be independently testable. You can:
- Follow the chapters sequentially for a complete learning experience
- Jump to specific topics as needed
- Complete the hands-on exercises to reinforce learning
- Take the quizzes to test your understanding

## Technical Requirements

- Ubuntu 22.04
- ROS 2 Humble
- Python 3.10+
- Basic programming knowledge

Let's begin your journey into Physical AI and ROS 2!
