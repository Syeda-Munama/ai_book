# Chapter 2: Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions

This chapter dives into the practical implementation of ROS 2 communication patterns. You'll learn how to implement ROS 2 nodes, topics, services, and actions for humanoid robots, bridging the gap between theory and practice in robotics.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this chapter, you will be able to:
- Create and manage ROS 2 nodes for humanoid robot control
- Implement publisher/subscriber communication patterns for robot joint control
- Use services and actions for more complex robot interactions
- Build basic humanoid control nodes using ROS 2 communication patterns
