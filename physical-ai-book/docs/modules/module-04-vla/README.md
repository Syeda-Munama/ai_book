# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

1. **Integrate speech recognition with robotic control systems** - Implement voice command processing using OpenAI's Whisper API and map natural language commands to robotic actions in ROS 2

2. **Design cognitive planning systems with LLMs** - Create high-level task decomposition and planning pipelines that translate complex user instructions into sequences of robotic actions

3. **Implement multi-modal perception for human-robot interaction** - Build systems that combine visual, auditory, and language inputs to enable natural interaction with humanoid robots

4. **Build complete VLA pipelines** - Create end-to-end systems that process "voice → plan → walk → grasp" workflows in simulation environments

5. **Test and validate VLA systems** - Deploy and test Vision-Language-Action systems in Isaac Sim simulation environment with realistic humanoid robots

## Module Overview

This module focuses on Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems - the integration of speech recognition, large language models, and robotic control to enable natural human-robot interaction. You'll learn to build systems that can understand voice commands, plan complex tasks, and execute them on humanoid robots.
