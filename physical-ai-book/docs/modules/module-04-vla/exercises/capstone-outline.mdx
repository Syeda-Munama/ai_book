# Capstone Project: Complete Vision-Language-Action Pipeline

## Project Overview

In this capstone project, you will implement a complete Vision-Language-Action (VLA) pipeline that integrates all components learned in Module 4. The system will accept voice commands, perform cognitive planning using LLMs, perceive the environment visually, and execute complex robotic actions in simulation.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this capstone project, you will demonstrate the ability to:

1. Integrate voice recognition, cognitive planning, and multi-modal perception
2. Create a complete "voice → plan → walk → grasp" pipeline
3. Implement error handling and recovery in complex robotic systems
4. Test and validate VLA systems in Isaac Sim simulation environment
5. Document and present your VLA system implementation

  2. Perceive: Locate objects in the room
  3. Execute: Navigate to objects, grasp and place in appropriate locations

### Use Case 2: Object Retrieval
- Voice Command: "Bring me the red water bottle from the kitchen"
- System Response:
  1. Plan: Navigate to kitchen, identify red bottle, grasp it, return
  2. Perceive: Confirm object identity and location
  3. Execute: Complete the retrieval task

### Use Case 3: Setting the Table
