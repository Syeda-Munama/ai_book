# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI and Robotics Book. This module focuses on ROS 2 as the middleware for robot control, bridging Python AI agents to ROS controllers, with emphasis on URDF for humanoids and embodied intelligence in physical environments.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand ROS 2 as the robotic nervous system connecting AI agents to physical robot control
- Implement ROS 2 nodes, topics, services, and actions for humanoid robots
- Build ROS 2 packages with Python (rclpy) and implement launch files, parameters, and URDF for humanoids
- Develop sophisticated movement algorithms using the robotic nervous system

## Module Structure

This module is organized into four main chapters:

1. **ROS 2 Architecture & Core Concepts**: Understanding ROS 2 as the robotic nervous system
2. **Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions**: Implementing communication patterns for humanoid robots
3. **Building ROS 2 Packages with Python (rclpy)**: Creating packages and controlling humanoids
4. **Launch Files, Parameters, and URDF for Humanoids**: Advanced configuration and modeling

## Prerequisites

- Basic programming skills in Python
- Understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Linux command line

## Environment Requirements

- Ubuntu 22.04
- ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill
- Gazebo Classic for simulation

Let's begin exploring how ROS 2 functions as the nervous system for humanoid robots!
