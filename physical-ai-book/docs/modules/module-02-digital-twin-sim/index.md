# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI and Robotics Book. This module focuses on creating digital twins for humanoid robots using Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for high-fidelity rendering. You'll learn how to build realistic simulation environments that bridge the gap between virtual and physical robotics.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Set up physics-based humanoid simulations with accurate gravity and collision detection
- Implement sensor simulation for LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs with realistic data output
- Integrate Unity with your simulation environment for high-fidelity rendering and visualization
- Understand sim-to-real transfer principles for human-robot interaction

## Module Structure

This module is organized into three main chapters:

1. **Gazebo Setup & Physics**: Learn to set up physics-based simulations with accurate gravity and collision detection
2. **Sensor Simulation**: Implement realistic sensor simulation for various robot sensors
3. **Unity Integration & Rendering**: Integrate Unity for high-fidelity visualization and human-robot interaction

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of ROS 2 concepts (covered in Module 1)
- Access to an RTX workstation for running simulations
- Familiarity with Linux and command-line tools

## Hardware Requirements

- NVIDIA RTX graphics card (minimum RTX 3060)
- 16GB+ RAM recommended
- Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS 2 Humble installed

Let's begin exploring the world of digital twins for robotics!
