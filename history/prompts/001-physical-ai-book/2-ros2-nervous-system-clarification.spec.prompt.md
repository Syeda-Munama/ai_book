# Module 1 - The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) - Clarification

## Prompt Text
spec Add these improvements:
- Rename branch to module-01-ros2-nervous-system
- Explicitly name the 4 chapters:
  1. ROS 2 Architecture & Core Concepts
  2. Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions
  3. Building ROS 2 Packages with Python (rclpy)
  4. Launch Files, Parameters, and URDF for Humanoids
- Add 4 specific diagram examples: ROS computation graph, topic communication flowchart, URDF tree for a 7-DoF humanoid arm, launch file hierarchy
- Add "Tested Environment" box: Ubuntu 22.04 + ROS 2 Humble + Gazebo Classic

## Response Text
Updated the specification for Module 1 - The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) to include all requested improvements: renamed the feature to reflect the ROS 2 nervous system focus, explicitly named the 4 chapters, added specific diagram examples, included the tested environment information, and updated all related content to align with the new focus on ROS 2 as the robotic nervous system connecting AI agents to physical robot control.

## Outcome
Successfully updated the specification with all requested improvements, creating a comprehensive specification for Module 1 focused on ROS 2 as the robotic nervous system for humanoid robotics education.

## Evaluation
The specification now clearly defines the 4 specific chapters, includes the requested diagram examples, specifies the tested environment, and maintains alignment with the educational goals for university students learning Physical AI for humanoid robotics.
