## Prompt

the book is not having chapters for module 2 and 3 also the main page is very simple i need to add colors that is neon purple and blue update the UI for the first page

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive specification for the book UI enhancement feature that addresses all user requirements:
1. Adding missing chapters for modules 2 and 3
2. Implementing a neon purple and blue color scheme
3. Updating the first page UI for better user experience

The specification includes user scenarios with priorities (P1-P3), functional requirements (FR-001 to FR-007), key entities, and measurable success criteria (SC-001 to SC-004).

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete feature specification created for book UI enhancement
- 🧪 Tests: Specification validated against quality criteria checklist
- 📁 Files: spec.md and requirements.md checklist created in specs/001-book-ui-enhancement/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for /sp.clarify or /sp.plan to continue development
- 🧠 Reflection: Specification addresses all user requirements with clear acceptance criteria

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All specification quality criteria met
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed with planning phase
